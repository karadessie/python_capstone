# python_capstone
My proposal for a global climate change system was nominated for the Earthshot Prize in 2021. My Python capstone project has been designed to include the basic functionality of
the system for the different stakeholder levels outlined. The personal app will be designed for all smart phone users, while the library app will be accessible to library patrons of 
participating libraries around the world. State, country, and global apps will display daily particulate and CO2 levels and climate change news, and also include links for resources for each area or application.
