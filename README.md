# python_capstone
My proposal for a global climate change system was nominated for the Earthshot Prize in 2021. My Python capstone project has been designed to include the basic functionality of this system for the different stakeholder levels outlined. The personal app will be designed for all smart phone users, while the community app will be accessible to all library patrons in communities around the world. State, country, and global apps will display daily air quality and CO2 emissions in addition to the top climate change news stories. System links and links for local, state, national and worldwide resources will also be included at each stakeholder level.
