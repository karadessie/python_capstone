# python_capstone
My proposal for a global climate change system was nominated for the Earthshot Prize in 2021. My Python capstone project has been designed to include the basic functionality of this system at the different stakeholder levels outlined in the proposal. The personal app is designed for all smart phone users, while the personal and community apps are accessible to all patrons of participating libraries in communities around the world. State or region, country, and global apps will display daily air quality and CO2 emission counts in addition to the top climate change news stories. System links and links for local, state, national and worldwide databases, systems amd resources are also included at each stakeholder level.

TESS is the acronym for The Earth Save System outlined in my global climate change system proposal.
