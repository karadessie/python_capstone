# python_capstone
My proposal for a global climate change system (The Earth Save System, or TESS) was nominated for the Earthshot Prize in 2021. This Python capstone project has been designed to include the basic functionality of the TESS system at the various stakeholder levels. The home and community apps are accessible to patrons of participating libraries with internet access in communities around the world. Community, state or region, national, and global apps display daily air quality and CO2 emission counts in addition to climate change news stories important to all stakeholders. Administrative functions are included for leaders and policy makers, including instant calling,  messaging and conferencing. Links to a multitude of local, state, national and worldwide governmental, scientific, sustainable and climate-related databases, systems and resources are also included at each stakeholder level (links included in this prototype are suggestions for further development, not a comprehensive list).

Community app is customizable by the community coordinator. Boards and board posts can be added or deleted. The community coordinator loads and maintains resource link databases for community and home apps that are requested, useful, or needed in their communities. All users are verified and added through the community library, and community coordinators update community news and eco-friendly events while maintaining the community app.

The TESS prototype for this capstone project will be written using Python, Jinja2, Flask-SQLAlchemy, and PostgreSQL. The system proposal, design and prototype are available to use in whole or in part.
