# python_capstone
My proposal for a global climate change system (The Earth Save System, or TESS) was nominated for the Earthshot Prize in 2021. This Python capstone project has been designed to include the basic functionality of the TESS system at the various stakeholder levels outlined. The home app is designed for all smart phone users, while the home and community apps are accessible to patrons of participating libraries in communities around the world. Community, state or region, national, and global apps display daily air quality and CO2 emission counts in addition to climate change news stories important to all stakeholders. Administrative functions are included for leaders and policy makers. Links to a multitude of local, state, national and worldwide databases, systems and resources are also included at each stakeholder level (links included in this prototype design are suggestions for further development, not a comprehensive list).

The TESS prototype for this capstone project will be written using Python, Flask, Jinja2, and MySQL. The system design and prototype are available to use with permission.
